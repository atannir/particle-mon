This regexp should match all the fields that we want.

Rough outline of the logic for preprocessing the existing file:
Open existing log file
Parse each group of lines to get a complete record
Calculate the row data to insert (including the convenience of day of week, day of month, hour, minute, etc)
Insert into SQLite database until no more lines

Rough outline of logic for parsing incoming records:
Take JSON POST data and validate
Calculate convenience data
Insert into database


Database schema:
Timestamp (unique)
Year
Month
Day of month
Day of week
Hour
Minute
Second (?)
Humidity
Temperature DHT
Temperature BMP
Light


Some graph ideas:

Utilization by hour during the last month (might look a little like the Github activity graph)
Percent active (light meter) over past 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days (Likely a pie chart for total, or wedges by minute)
Line graph for light levels, humidity, temperature, pressure
