This will be done in cadubi because Fritzing is having a few issues on Raspbian


Breadboard

Particle Photon

BMP180 Temperature and Pressure sensor with breakout board (4 pins)

DHT11 Humidity and Temperature sensor (3 pin version preferred, 4 pin has one unused connection)

CdS photocell

Hookup wires

Small square of electrical tape

1 8.2K resistor (or similar)

1 10K resistor


With the USB port on the Particle Photon board at the top, pin 1 is at top left, which provides 5V.

Pin 1 will be connected to Vin for the BMP180.
Pin 2 is ground and will be connected to GND pin for the BMP180 (next to Vin).
Pin 2 is also connected with the 8.2K resistor to pin 7.
Pin 7 is also connected with the photoresistor to pin 24 (3.3V, top right).
Pin 13 (SDA) and pin 14 (SCL) are connected to the SCL and SDA pins on the BMP180 breakout board.
(To be continued.)
