This will be done in cadubi because Fritzing is having a few issues on Raspbian


Breadboard

Particle Photon

BMP180 Temperature and Pressure sensor

DHT11 Humidity and Temperature sensor

CdS photocell

Hookup wires

Small square of electrical tape

1 8.2K resistor (or similar)

1 10K resistor


With the USB port on the Particle Photon board at the top, pin 1 is at top left, which provides 5V.

Pin 1 will be connected to Vin for the BMP180.
Pin 2 is ground and will be connected to GND pin for the BMP180 (next to Vin).
Pin 2 is also connected with the 8.2K resistor to pin 7.
Pin 7 is also connected with the photoresistor to pin 24 (3.3V, top right).
(To be continued.)
